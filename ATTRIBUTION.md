# Licences, data sources and attribution

Everything on the map is built from open data. No Google, Apple, Bing or other proprietary map content
(imagery, 3D tiles, geometry) is used, not even as a reference.

**Mondo Isometrico** is a fork of [Isometric World](https://github.com/krasun/isometricworld) by
Dmytro Krasun (MIT), focused on Rome.

## This repository

| What | Licence |
|---|---|
| Source code (`pipeline/`, `web/`, scripts) | [MIT](LICENSE) |
| Map imagery (published tiles), `video/`, `pipeline/style/` | [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) by Domenico Gagliardi (derived from the Isometric World pipeline), **plus the data credits below**, which must be kept with any copy |

The imagery and videos are *Produced Works* under the ODbL (see OpenStreetMap below): their own licence is
free to choose, but the OpenStreetMap notice must stay with them. AI-painted images may not be protected by
copyright everywhere; where they are, CC BY 4.0 applies.

## Credit line

Shown on the map (footer), in video mode and on every clip; use it on reposts, captions and end cards:

> Map data © OpenStreetMap contributors · Terrain: Copernicus DEM © DLR, Airbus DS · Painted with AI

Each region lists its own credit lines in `pipeline/src/places.ts` (`credits`).

## Data sources

| Source | Used for | Licence | Obligations |
|---|---|---|---|
| [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) (via the Overpass API) | ground (roads, pavements, parks, water, rail, landuse), buildings and trees in Rome (current), municipal borders, roads for the traffic animation | [ODbL 1.0](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/) | "© OpenStreetMap contributors" visible with the map and videos. Map images and videos are Produced Works (no share-alike on them). The data the pipeline derives by joining OSM with other data is a Derivative Database: it is not redistributed, and `pipeline/` (this repository) is the published method to recreate it. |
| [Copernicus DEM GLO-30](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/explore-data/data-collections/copernicus-contributing-missions/collections-description/COP-DEM) (AWS Open Data) | terrain height | Copernicus DEM licence: free, including commercial use | "© DLR e.V. 2010-2014 and © Airbus Defence and Space GmbH 2014-2018 provided under COPERNICUS by the European Union and ESA; all rights reserved". |

### Planned (not wired yet)

| Source | Intended use | Licence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Regione Lazio DBT 2014](https://geoportale.regione.lazio.it/) | building footprints + surveyed eaves heights | CC BY 4.0 | Better heights than OSM; cite when added to `fetch.ts` / `scene.ts`. |
| [Roma Capitale GeoRoma](https://geoportale.comune.roma.it/) (WFS/WMS) | municipal layers | [CC BY 4.0](https://dati.comune.roma.it/od/it/legal.page) (open-data portal) | Check layer metadata before use; cite Roma Capitale. |

None of this data is in the repository: `npm run fetch` downloads it into `data/` (ignored by git).

## AI painting

Render tiles are repainted by OpenAI's image model through the Codex CLI (ChatGPT account). OpenAI's terms
assign the output rights to the user. No credit is required; the map and clips say "Painted with AI" because
social platforms ask for AI-generated content to be labelled.

Everything in `pipeline/style/` was painted the same way for the upstream project: `reference.png` (house
style), `trees.png` (tree species sheet — Mediterranean-friendly enough for a first Rome pass; a Rome-specific
sheet can replace it later) and `sea.png`.
